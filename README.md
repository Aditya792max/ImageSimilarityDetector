ImageSimilarityDetector

A Python tool to detect and analyse similarity between images. Designed to help you find visually similar or duplicate images, extract feature embeddings, and perform image-comparison tasks in a project or production setting.

🚀 Why this project

In many workflows (image de-duplication, dataset cleanup, reverse image lookup, content moderation, visual search) it’s often useful to automatically identify images that are very similar (or duplicates) rather than fully distinct.
This project provides a lightweight, modular pipeline to:
	•	Load a collection of images
	•	Compute embeddings/features for each image
	•	Compute pair-wise similarity or nearest neighbours
	•	Report similar/duplicate pairs or clusters
	•	Optionally visualise the results or embed them in downstream workflows

⸻

🎯 Key Features
	•	Image loading + processing (supports common formats: JPG, PNG, etc)
	•	Feature extraction (e.g., via pre-trained model or simple descriptor)
	•	Embedding computation and storage
	•	Similarity search: compare embeddings, compute distances, threshold for “similar”
	•	Output / report generation: list of similarly matched images, clusters, metrics
	•	Optional visualisation of similar image sets

🧱 Project Structure

Here’s a typical folder layout:

ImageSimilarityDetector/
├─ data/                  # optionally store your images here
├─ embeddings/            # directory to store computed embeddings
├─ src/
│   ├─ extract_features.py   # script to compute features/embeddings for images
│   ├─ compute_similarity.py # script to compute similarity between embeddings
│   └─ utils.py              # helper functions (loading images, preprocessing, etc)
├─ results/               # results output (e.g., CSV lists of similar image pairs)
├─ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
└─ README.md

🛠 Installation & Setup
	1.	Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Aditya792max/ImageSimilarityDetector.git
cd ImageSimilarityDetector


	2.	(Optional) Create a virtual environment

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # on Linux/macOS
# or on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


	3.	Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


	4.	Prepare your image dataset: place images in a folder under data/ (or adjust the script to point to your folder).

✅ Usage Example

Here’s a basic workflow:
	1.	Extract features

python src/extract_features.py --input_dir data/images --output embeddings/features.npy

This loads all images from data/images, computes embeddings (e.g., via pre-trained model), and saves them to embeddings/features.npy.

	2.	Compute similarity

python src/compute_similarity.py --embeddings embeddings/features.npy --threshold 0.9 --report results/similar_pairs.csv

This loads the embeddings, computes pair-wise similarities (or nearest neighbours), applies a threshold (e.g., similarity ≥ 0.9), and writes out a CSV report listing image pairs that are considered similar.

	3.	(Optional) View results
Open the CSV or use a quick script/notebook to visualise image pairs, inspect clusters, etc.

🧠 How It Works (Summary)
	•	Image Preprocessing: The images are loaded and optionally resized or normalised.
	•	Feature Extraction: A model (for example a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network) converts each image into a vector embedding that captures its visual essence.
	•	Similarity Computation: Similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance) are computed between embeddings.
	•	Thresholding / Nearest Neighbours: Based on a threshold (or top-k nearest neighbours) you identify which images are “similar”.
	•	Result Output: The matched pairs/clusters are written to output for further analysis.

⸻

📋 Configuration & Options
	•	--input_dir: folder containing images
	•	--output: path for embeddings or result file
	•	--threshold: similarity threshold (e.g., 0.9)
	•	--metric: which similarity metric to use (cosine / euclidean)
	•	--top_k: optionally report top-k neighbours for each image instead of threshold

(Ensure these flags match your actual script parameters.)

🧪 Example Use-Case

Suppose you have a dataset of 10,000 product images and you suspect there are many duplicates or near-duplicates (e.g., same image under different filenames or small edits).

	1.	Use extract_features.py to embed all 10k images.
	2.	Use compute_similarity.py with a threshold of 0.95 to detect very similar image pairs.
	3.	Review similar_pairs.csv, then you might delete duplicates, or consolidate variants, improving your dataset quality.

🔧 Future Improvements
	•	Speed up similarity via Approximate Nearest Neighbors (e.g., FAISS).
	•	Use more powerful embedding models (EfficientNet, Vision Transformers) for better feature robustness.
	•	Integrate clustering (group similar images into clusters, not just pairs).
	•	Build a small UI or command-line interactive tool for exploring results.
	•	Add more metrics (precision/recall) if you have ground-truth for duplicates.
	•	Add handling for very large datasets (out-of-memory embedding storage, incremental indexing).
