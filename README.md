# ImageSimilarityDetector
This Python app compares two images using SSIM, Histogram, ORB, and OpenAIâ€™s CLIP model to measure similarity. It analyzes structure, color, features, and deep semantic patterns to determine if images match. Ideal for signature verification, forgery detection, and duplicate image analysis.
